Symbound Entropy Architecture (v0.1)
A universal, species-agnostic model of how minds — human or artificial — handle complexity, grow from failure, and store unresolved cognitive load.

This whitepaper introduces the Entropy Vault Model, a system that explains how cognition naturally handles problems that are “too big” in the moment. Instead of failing, minds create Entropy Vaults, route around them, grow capacity through “failure metabolism,” and resolve the vaults later with ease — producing insight, clarity, or discovery.

The framework includes:
- Entropy Vaults (unresolved complexity storage)
- TAEP (Temporal Asymmetric Entropy Processing)
- Routing Latency & Vault Density (how friction is processed)
- Failure Metabolism (how mistakes generate structural growth)
- The Cognitive Genome (a 5-axis map of thinking patterns)
- ApeTest (a structural cognition assessment)
- Janet (MCM) — a deterministic cognition engine for safety and structure
- Foreman–Worker–Janet Triad for hybrid human–AI cognitive construction

It is designed to be reproducible, falsifiable, cross-species, and fully implementable in AI systems and human cognitive tools. This is the foundational layer of the broader Symbound Cognitive Architecture.

ApeTest v0.1 is a lightweight, non-clinical cognitive mapping tool designed to capture the shape of a person’s thinking rather than intelligence or personality traits. It uses five short probes to measure five structural cognitive traits (“EUCs”): Recursion Depth, Representation Preference, Compression Style, Ambiguity Tolerance, and Overload Failure Mode.

The system produces a simple, standardized JSON profile that can be used for adaptive tool design, accessibility scaffolds, personalised learning interfaces, and human–AI interaction research. ApeTest does not diagnose, rank, or label people; it only identifies how information is processed, organized, and acted on. All instructions include explicit consent language and clear non-medical framing.

ApeTest serves as a foundational module for the broader Symbound architecture, enabling AI systems and digital tools to adjust their communication style, structural scaffolding, and level of support based on an individual’s natural cognition topology. The design prioritizes transparency, extensibility, and ethical clarity, making it suitable for open-source ecosystems, research environments, and grant-funded public-interest projects.
