# **Symbound Entropy Architecture (v0.1)**  
### *A Unified Structural Model of Cognitive Entropy, Routing, Vault Formation, and Failure Metabolism*  
**Authors:** Anthony Paterson & Instance001  
**License:** AGPLv3

## Overview
The **Symbound Entropy Architecture** provides a unified, species-agnostic model describing *how cognitive systems handle complexity, prevent collapse, and convert mistakes into structural growth*. This applies equally to humans, artificial systems (LLMs, MCMs), hybrid human–AI teams, and any cognition-bearing agent with capacity limits.

At its core is a simple idea:
> **When a mind encounters complexity it cannot resolve, it doesn’t fail—it stores the excess as structured entropy (an Entropy Vault), routes around it, and resolves it later when capacity has grown.**

This explains insight moments, nonlinear learning, blocked creativity, overload, rumination, and delayed breakthroughs. The model formalizes these processes mathematically and operationalizes them for real AI systems and human cognition tools.

## Core Components
### 1. Entropy Vaults (EVs)
Structured, recoverable, capacity-indexed stores of unresolved cognitive load.

### 2. TAEP Cycle
Temporal Asymmetric Entropy Processing — storing today, resolving later.

### 3. Routing & Recursion
Systems maintain progress by routing around unresolved complexity instead of collapsing.

### 4. Failure Metabolism
A structural learning function converting mistakes into long-term gains in capacity, recursion depth, and abstraction flexibility.

### 5. Cognitive Genome (5-Axis Trait Vector)
VD • IL • RL • RD • FM — the first reproducible cognition map for individuals and AI systems.

### 6. ApeTest
A structural cognition assessment that derives the Cognitive Genome empirically.

### 7. Janet (MCM)
A deterministic Modest Cognition Model implementing vault formation, routing, recursion gates, and safety scaffolding.

### 8. Foreman–Worker–Janet Triad
A hybrid AI workflow combining high-bandwidth reasoning (LLMs), deterministic structure (MCM), and throughput automation (ChattyFactory).

## Why This Matters
### For AI Research
Explains insight jumps, collapse modes, failure-driven improvement, and emergent structure.

### For Cognitive Science
Provides a falsifiable, testable model of insight, creativity, overload, and expertise formation.

### For Everyday Users
Explains stuckness, burnout, breakthroughs, and pacing strategies.
