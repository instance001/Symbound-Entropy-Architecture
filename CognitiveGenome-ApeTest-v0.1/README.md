# 🧬 Cognitive Genome – ApeTest v0.1

**Status:** v0.1 – Experimental, non-clinical  
**Location:** Part of the Symbound Entropy Architecture toolchain
Released under AGPLv3 license.

ApeTest v0.1 is a small, extensible **cognition topology snapshot**.  
It does **not** measure IQ, personality, or clinical traits. It just tries to map the **shape of thinking** using 5 probes and 5 structural traits (“EUCs”).

For full theory, rubric, and JSON schema, see:

- [`CognitiveGenome_ApeTest_v0.1.md`](./CognitiveGenome_ApeTest_v0.1.md)

## 0. Scope & Ethics (Plain Language)

- **Not for:**
  - Diagnosis
  - Labeling people as better/worse
  - Gatekeeping access

- **For:**
  - Self-understanding
  - Matching people with tools / cognitive prosthetics
  - Research on cognitive structure
  - Building better human–AI scaffolds

**Consent preamble:**

> This is an experimental cognitive mapping exercise.  
> It’s not a test of intelligence, and it’s not medical.  
> It’s just trying to understand *how* you think — not *how well* you think.

## 1. The 5 EUCs (v0.1)

Each EUC is produced by a single probe:

1. `RecursionDepth` – how far you comfortably track causal chains  
2. `RepresentationPreference` – how you naturally explain systems (parts, stories, procedures, etc.)  
3. `CompressionStyle` – what survives when you summarise  
4. `AmbiguityTolerance` – first move when the brief is fuzzy  
5. `OverloadFailureMode` – pattern under too many tasks at once

The detailed prompts and scoring rubrics are defined in the spec document.

---

## 2. Running the Test (CLI)

### 2.1 Collect raw responses

Use the CLI runner to collect a single subject’s raw responses:

```bash
cd ApeTest

python ape_test_v0_1.py
````

You’ll see a short intro and then 5 probes:

1. Dam → farms → city food → prices → who can live there
2. Explain how a bicycle works to someone who has never seen one
3. Summarise a chaotic-kitchen story in one sentence
4. “Improve the system” with no definition
5. Ten-task overload scenario

At the end, the script writes a raw JSON file, e.g.:

```text
cognitive_genome_raw_anon-12ab34cd_20251119T123456Z.json
```

This file contains:

* `subject_id`
* Timestamp
* The 5 raw probe responses
* Notes indicating that EUC labels must be added by a scoring layer

## 3. Scoring Options

You can score the raw responses either **manually** (human rater) or via an **LLM**.

### 3.1 Manual scoring – `ape_score_v0_1.py`

Interactive CLI tool for a human rater.

```bash
cd ApeTest

python ape_score_v0_1.py
````

You’ll be prompted for the path to a raw file, e.g.:

```text
Enter path to raw responses JSON file: cognitive_genome_raw_anon-12ab34cd_20251119T123456Z.json
```

For each probe, the tool:

* Shows the subject’s text
* Presents rubric-based options
* Asks you to choose:

  * `RecursionDepth` (one)
  * `RepresentationPreference` (1–2)
  * `CompressionStyle` (1–2)
  * `AmbiguityTolerance` (one)
  * `OverloadFailureMode` (one)
* Optionally records free-text notes

The output is a **Cognitive Genome v0.1 profile**, e.g.:

```json
{
  "version": "CognitiveGenome_v0.1",
  "subject_id": "anon-12ab34cd",
  "timestamp_utc": "2025-11-19T12:34:56Z",
  "eucs": {
    "RecursionDepth": "Deep",
    "RepresentationPreference": ["SpatialMechanical", "Procedural"],
    "CompressionStyle": ["Structure", "Pattern"],
    "AmbiguityTolerance": "High",
    "OverloadFailureMode": "Scatter"
  },
  "notes": {
    "free_text": "Optional scorer notes here.",
    "rubric": "Scored using Cognitive Genome – ApeTest v0.1 manual rubric."
  },
  "source_raw_file": "/absolute/path/to/raw/file.json"
}
```

(Shape taken from the scoring snippet.) 

The profile is written to a file like:

```text
cognitive_genome_profile_<subject_id>_<timestamp>.json
```

---

### 3.2 LLM-based scoring – `ape_score_llm_v0_1.py`

If you want an LLM to apply the rubric automatically:

1. Implement `call_llm(prompt: str) -> str` inside `ape_score_llm_v0_1.py`
   – this can call any OpenAI-compatible endpoint or local model.

2. Run:

```bash
cd ApeTest

python ape_score_llm_v0_1.py
```

3. When prompted, provide the raw responses JSON path.

The script:

* Builds a detailed rubric prompt (with definitions of each EUC and label space)
* Sends the prompt + probe responses to your LLM
* Expects a **strict JSON object**:

```json
{
  "RecursionDepth": "Shallow | Medium | Deep | VeryDeep",
  "RepresentationPreference": ["Verbal", "SpatialMechanical", "Narrative", "Procedural", "Metaphorical"],
  "CompressionStyle": ["Structure", "Detail", "Pattern", "Narrative", "EmotionalImpact"],
  "AmbiguityTolerance": "Low | Medium | High",
  "OverloadFailureMode": "Scatter | Freeze | Loop | Oversimplify"
}
```



4. If the JSON parses correctly, a profile file named something like:

```text
cognitive_genome_profile_llm_<subject_id>_<timestamp>.json
```

is written alongside a printed summary of the EUCs.

## 4. Data & File Hygiene

ApeTest produces:

* Raw responses:
  `cognitive_genome_raw_<subject_id>_<timestamp>.json`
* Scored profiles (manual):
  `cognitive_genome_profile_<subject_id>_<timestamp>.json`
* Scored profiles (LLM):
  `cognitive_genome_profile_llm_<subject_id>_<timestamp>.json`

If you’re using Git, you may want to **ignore** locally generated response/profile files:

```gitignore
# ApeTest generated data
cognitive_genome_raw_*.json
cognitive_genome_profile_*.json
cognitive_genome_profile_llm_*.json
```

---

## 5. Packaged Release

For convenience, this folder also contains a packaged bundle:

* `dist/CognitiveGenome-ApeTest-v0.1.zip`

This is intended as a drop-in for:

* Researchers
* Tool builders
* Grant reviewers
* Anyone who wants a single ZIP of:

  * Spec
  * CLI scripts
  * Example schema

---

## 6. Downstream Use

The EUC profiles are designed to be **hook points** into:

* Adaptive UIs
* Learning systems
* Human–AI prosthetics
* Coaching / scaffolding tools

The schema is intentionally simple and JSON-first so:

* You can use it in dashboards, notebooks, or pipelines.
* Others can extend it with more EUCs or alternative probes.
