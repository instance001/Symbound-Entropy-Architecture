## Symbound-Entropy-Architecture
| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Symbound Entropy Architecture | SEA | ~ | ~ | Unified entropy handling model | Structural model describing how cognition stores unresolved load in Entropy Vaults, routes around it (TAEP), and metabolizes failure into capacity growth | Not metaphysical; not limited to AI—applies to human and hybrid systems | Symbound-Entropy-Architecture/README-2.md |
| Entropy Vault (EV) | vault | ~ | ~ | Structured backlog | Recoverable, capacity-indexed store of unresolved cognitive load | Not discarded noise; not unstructured log | Symbound-Entropy-Architecture/README-2.md |
| TAEP cycle | Temporal Asymmetric Entropy Processing | ~ | ~ | Deferred resolution loop | Process of storing unresolved complexity now and resolving later when capacity increases | Not a claim of perpetual motion; scheduling heuristic | Symbound-Entropy-Architecture/README-2.md |
| Failure metabolism | failure metabolism | = | ~ | Learning function | Mechanism converting mistakes into capacity, recursion depth, abstraction flexibility | Not punishment; not error suppression | Symbound-Entropy-Architecture/README-2.md |
| Cognitive Genome (5-Axis) | VD, IL, RL, RD, FM | ~ | ~ | Trait vector | Five-axis structural cognition map derived via ApeTest | Not personality typing; not psychometric test | Symbound-Entropy-Architecture/README-2.md; CognitiveGenome_ApeTest_v0.1.md |
| ApeTest | Ape Test | = | ~ | Structural cognition assessment | Assessment pipeline deriving Cognitive Genome traits from tasks; includes scripts (ape_score, ape_test) | Not IQ or benchmark of general intelligence; structure-focused | Symbound-Entropy-Architecture/CognitiveGenome_ApeTest_v0.1.md |
| Foreman–Worker–Janet Triad | triad | ~ | ~ | Hybrid workflow | Workflow combining LLM foreman, worker automation, and Janet MCM deterministic core | Not a single model; not black-box orchestration | Symbound-Entropy-Architecture/README-2.md |
