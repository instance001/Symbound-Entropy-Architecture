Abstract — Symbound Entropy Architecture (v0.1)
This whitepaper presents the Symbound Entropy Architecture, a unified structural model describing how cognitive systems — human, artificial, or hybrid — process unresolved complexity, avoid collapse, and convert error into growth. The framework introduces the Entropy Vault System, a mechanism in which high-cost cognitive structures are stored temporarily (“vaulted”) when exceeding system capacity, enabling continued progress through deterministic routing. Capacity increases over time via Failure Metabolism, a structural learning function transforming mistakes into cognitive growth increments. Vaults resolve automatically when capacity surpasses their entropy magnitude, producing insight or “Eureka” events.

We formalize the architecture mathematically (Entropy E, Capacity C(t), Recursion Depth RD, Routing Latency RL), provide pseudocode for implementation, and define the Cognitive Genome, a five-axis trait vector (VD, IL, RL, RD, FM) enabling cross-individual cognitive mapping. A companion assessment, ApeTest, derives these traits empirically.

The architecture is fully implemented in a deterministic Modest Cognition Model (MCM) named Janet, and extended through a hybrid multi-agent workflow (Foreman–Worker–Janet), enabling reproducible cognitive construction in AI pipelines. This document forms Part I of the broader Symbound Cognitive Architecture and provides the substrate on which higher-level cognitive models will be built.
